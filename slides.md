# Let's Prevent That

## Image Alt Text
- Make it accurate
- Make it concise
- Don't be redundant
- Don't use "image of" or "graphic of"

<br>

```html
// Bad example, no alt text ‚ùå
<img src="bandung.jpg" />

// Bad example, we already know that was a picture ‚ùå
<img alt="Picture of Bandung" src="bandung.jpg" />

// Good example ‚úÖ
<img alt="Scenery of Bandung city" src="bandung.jpg" />

// Good example, if it's just decorative image ‚úÖ
<img alt="" src="pattern.jpg" />
```

---
layout: bullets
---

## Semantic HTML
- Always prefer use appropriate element
- Use sorted headings (h1-h6) and landmarks

<br>

```html
// Bad example, use "button" instead ‚ùå
<div onclick="btnClicked()">Click Me</div>

// Bad example, use "h1" instead ‚ùå
<p class="header-1" />

// Good example, use tag properly ‚úÖ
<a href="twitter.com">Navigate to Twitter</a>
```

- If have to, you can use ARIA attributes to mimic it

```html
// Imitate 'button' element into a 'div'
<div tabindex="0" role="button" class="button" onclick="btnClicked()" onKeyUp="btnClicked()">
  Click Me
</div>
```

<br>

layout: intro-image-right
image: '/images/focus.png'
---

# Focus Management
- KEEP the focus ring
- Make interactive element can be focused (button, link, input, etc)

---
layout: bullets
---

## ARIA Attributes
- Accessible Rich Internet Applications

<br>

```html {all|3|4|5|6|all}
// Try to imitate button
<span
  class="button"
  tabindex="0"
  role="button"
  onclick="btnClicked()"
>
  Click Me
</span>
```

```html {all|2-4|6-9|all}
// If button don't have text label
<a aria-label="Login button">
  <icon>mdi_login</icon>
</a>

<a aria-labelledby="login_label">
  <icon>mdi_login</icon>
</a>
<span id="login_label"></span>
```

## Announcements
- User know what happened / changed

```jsx
<div
  id="error" 
  aria-live="off" // off | polite | assertive
  aria-relevant="additions text" // additions, text, removal
>	
  { isValid ? '' : errorText }
</div>
```

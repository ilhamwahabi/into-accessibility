# Let's Prevent That

## Image Alt Text
- Make it accurate
- Make it concise
- Don't be redundant
- Don't use "image of" or "graphic of"

<br>

```html
// Bad example, no alt text ‚ùå
<img src="bandung.jpg" />

// Bad example, we already know that was picture ‚ùå
<img alt="Picture of Bandung" src="bandung.jpg" />

// Good example ‚úÖ
<img alt="Scenery of Bandung city" src="bandung.jpg" />

// Good example, if it's just decorative image ‚úÖ
<img alt="" src="pattern.jpg" />
```

---

## ARIA Attributes

<br>

---
layout: bullets
---

## Semantic HTML
- Always prefer use appropriate element
- Use sorted headings (h1-h6) and landmarks

<br>

```html
// Bad example, use "button" instead ‚ùå
<div onclick="submitForm()">Click Me</div>

// Bad example, use "h1" instead ‚ùå
<p class="header-1" />

// Good example, use tag properly ‚úÖ
<a href="twitter.com">Navigate to Twitter</a>
```

- If forced, you can use ARIA attributes to mimic it

```html
// Mimic 'button' element into a 'div'
<div tabindex="0" role="button" class="button" onclick="btnClicked()" onKeyUp="btnClicked()">
  Click Me
</div>
```

# Let's Prevent That

---

## Image Alt Text ( \<img alt="..." \/\> )

<v-clicks>

- Make it accurate
- Make it concise
- Don't be redundant
- Don't use "image of" or "graphic of"
- If just decorative, use empty string to make it ignored

</v-clicks>

<br>

<v-click>

```html{1-2|4-5|7-8|10-11|all}
<!-- Bad example, no alt text ‚ùå -->
<img src="bandung.jpg" />

<!-- Bad example, we already know that was a picture ‚ùå -->
<img alt="Picture of Bandung" src="bandung.jpg" />

<!-- Good example ‚úÖ -->
<img alt="The heavy traffic of Bandung city" src="bandung.jpg" />

<!-- Good example, if it's just decorative image ‚úÖ -->
<img alt="" src="pattern.jpg" />
```

</v-click>

## Semantic HTML
- Always prefer appropriate native element
- Use headings hierarchically (h1-h6)
- Use landmarks (header, footer, etc)
- If you have to, use proper attributes to mimic it

<br>

```html
<!-- Bad example, prefer "button" instead ‚ùå -->
<div onclick="btnClicked()">Click Me</div>

<!-- Bad example, prefer "h1" instead ‚ùå -->
<p class="header-1" />

<!-- Bad example, heading should used hierarchically ‚ùå -->
<main>
  <h1>Ilham Blogs</h1>
  <h6>Getting Started in React</h6>
</main>

<!-- Good example, use tag properly ‚úÖ -->
<a href="twitter.com">Navigate to Twitter</a>
```

# Color Contrast
- Element color and background color should have clear differentiation
- You can check in dev tools or using browser extension

<br>

---
layout: intro-image-right

---

# Focus Management
- KEEP the focus ring
- Make interactive element can be focused (button, link, input, etc)

---

## ARIA Attributes
- Accessible Rich Internet Applications
- ARIA is a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements that define ways to make web content and applications accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technologies

<br>

```jsx {all|2|3|all}
// Declare that a element is hidden 
<div id="popup" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true">
  <p>I'm hidden</p>
</div>
```

```html {all|2-4|6-9|all}
<!-- Adding a label to button without text -->
<a aria-label="Login button">
  <icon>mdi_login</icon>
</a>

<!-- You can also doing it this way -->
<a aria-labelledby="login_label">
  <icon>mdi_login</icon>
</a>
<span id="login_label">Login button</span>
```

---

## Announcements
- User know what happened / changed
- Example usage: error message and adding items to the cart

<br>

```jsx
// Notify user if there is error
<div
  id="error" 
  aria-live="assertive"
  aria-atomic="true"
  aria-relevant="additions text"
>
  { isValid ? '' : errorText }
</div>
```
